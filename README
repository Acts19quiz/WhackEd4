WhackEd4
========

Description
-----------
As a replacement for the DOS-based Dehacked, WhackEd4 allows you to load and edit Doom Dehacked files.
It also expands on the features of the original Dehacked:

- A configurable workspace with separate editor windows.
- Sprite previews from a loaded IWAD and PWADs.
- Full support for Boom's extensions such as codepointer and thing flag mnemonics.
- Editing multiple states at the same time.
- Filtering the displayed list of states by thing states, weapon states or unused states.
- Does not require a Doom executable, but reads engine data from table files.


Dependencies
------------
WhackEd4 is built with Python 2.7, wxPython 2.9.4.0. The user interface is designed using wxFormBuilder.
To build the setup executable you will need cx_Freeze and Inno Setup.

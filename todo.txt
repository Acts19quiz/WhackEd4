Bug
- VGA: MBF (non-beta) config has beta states including beta actions. http://www.doomworld.com/vb/post/1358105
- VGA: "Can you also make the States filter list update itself after the player renames something? Because now it keeps showing the old thing names until it reloads the file."

Features
- Press space in the state editor or right mouse button on a state label to start a preview animation at that state.
- Somewhere to display state action descriptions?
- UI manual \ Dehacked tutorial.
- Allow sorting things list by name.
- Tab control traversal. Will need UI layout changes (put controls into panels instead of directly into frames).
- Read\write DEHACKED lumps directly from a WAD file.

Known issues
- When listview column widths are resized, a scrollbar is sometimes displayed for no reason.
- Toolbar buttons clickable area does not extend to the side of the toolbar. Another wxWidgets bug.

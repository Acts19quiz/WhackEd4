Features
- If an editor dialog is maximized, clicking an already active editor in the toolbar should just bring that window to the front, maximized.
- Press space in the state editor or right mouse button on a state label to start a preview animation at that state.
- Somewhere to display state action descriptions?
- ESC should close dialogs where appropriate, for example the string editor.
- UI manual \ Dehacked tutorial.
- Allow sorting things list by name.
- Tab control traversal. Will need UI layout changes (put controls into panels instead of directly into frames).

Known issues
- When listview column widths are resized, a scrollbar is sometimes displayed for no reason.
- Toolbar buttons clickable area does not extend to the side of the toolbar. Another wxWidgets bug.

Known bugs
- settings.json ended up being empty: https://www.doomworld.com/vb/doom-editing/89861-whacked4-problem/
- Thing editor property fields do not scale well when resized.
- Fix column widths with different font sizes. Auto-sizing based on font and text contents?

Low priority bugs
- State Editor: flash when selecting states. Related to parameters UI.
- When listview column widths are resized, a scrollbar is sometimes displayed for no reason.
- Toolbar buttons clickable area does not extend to the side of the toolbar. An old wxWidgets bug\regression.
- Proper HiDPI support. WxWidgets sucks for this.

Features
1.2.0
- State unused1 and unused2 are used by weapon frames to denote weapon sprite offsets, but now they are always hidden if
  the action on that state does not use them. Always show these if the action does not use them, since this is even a
  vanilla feature. https://www.doomworld.com/forum/topic/62909-whacked-4/?do=findComment&comment=1755062
- Press space in the state editor or right mouse button on a state label to start a preview animation at that state.
- If possible, can you add a feature to make all Mapthings, States etc. Blank? Make all mapthings flag checked off, uses
  no sprites, etc. Basically similar to that 'Extra things' from Doom retro. For the states also similar to that from
  Doom retro's extra stuff, changes all sprite to TNT1A0 makes the duration 0, etc.
- Add DooMRetro "Gib health" thing property. See https://github.com/bradharding/doomretro/commit/64cba7dbb9e952a6d56ddccf25c650c64ffdc389
- Allow multiple flag fields for things (and implement Doom Retro's "Retro Bits" field).
- Allow sorting things list by name.

1.3.0
- Mark and display items as modified compared to engine config.
- '...' button for actions to browse through list of actions plus a description.
- VGA: "Also, it would be cool if the states had one extra column with the name of the thing that is using them."
  - Check to see if any things use states that use the wrong type of action (weapon or monster).
- Simplify engine config structure for faster parsing.
- Merge patches by loading a patch "over" the current one.
  - Or like https://www.doomworld.com/vb/post/1556253
- DEHSUPP support. See GitHub issue #1.
- ZDaemon: Add and parse relevant actors from http://www.zdaemon.org/?CMD=info&NAME=deh. Is this related to DEHSUPP?
- UI manual \ Dehacked tutorial.
- Read\write DEHACKED lumps directly from a WAD file.
- Allow includes for cfg files to modularize them.
- Improve tab traversal everywhere.

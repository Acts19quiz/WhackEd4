Bugs
- you can't set negative frame durations, which is required when setting them to -1 on corpses or simple decorations.
- flag lists separated by signs like | (the pipe symbol) aren't parsed. Boom supports that as well as the comma (I think).
- MBF strictly beta emulation codepointers such as BetaSkullAttack are not recognized in MBF normal mode (and it will crash on launch) but are probably recognized by Eternity, ZDoom and PrBoom+. Not a bug though, it's just that the user has to be careful when aiming the DEH for vanilla MBF.
- Whacked4 crashes if the sprite format from the WAD is invalid. A common SLADE mistake is to import the PNG files and forget to convert them to Doom format before loading the WAD in Whacked4.
- I've been getting crashes when switching from the thing window to the frame window, or when using the frame filter. However, I was using Whacked4 through Wine so I can't be sure for now. I'll send you tracebacks if it happens later, on Windows.

Features
- Allow sorting things list by name.
- the thing table lacks numbers. I need to look up the things by numbers when using the Spawn codepointer with the number as argument.
- the frame filter doesn't recognize RandomJump destinations, it only recognizes Next Frame destinations.

Known issues
- Tab key traversal barely works if at all. Probably a bug in wxWidgets 2.9.
- When listview column widths are resized, a scrollbar is sometimes displayed for no reason.

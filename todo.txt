- New state list needs more debugging.
- DEHEXTRA configuration with missing bits and pieces from https://doomwiki.org/wiki/DEHEXTRA. Doom Retro would extend this. Also see https://www.doomworld.com/forum/post/2177644
    - Finish boolean fullbright saving
    - New sounds start at index 500, between those and new ones there must be reserved sounds that are not editable.
- Add warnings when loading patches that reference things\states\etc. that do not exist, from https://www.doomworld.com/forum/post/2123386
- Calculated % number next to a thing's pain chance.
- Fix editor list column widths.

Known bugs
- State animation preview should not display states with 0 duration? But still run it's actions. See DV4 fist attack.
- State animation preview should use parameters 1 and 2 to offset sprite. (If weapon?)
- When opening a new patch file after modifying the current one, no warning is given and the new patch is loaded immediately.
- "I get this error when trying to open a .deh file directly instead of launching WhackEd4 on its own:" https://www.doomworld.com/forum/post/2112985

Low priority bugs
- When listview column widths are resized, a scrollbar is sometimes displayed for no reason.
- Toolbar buttons clickable area does not extend to the side of the toolbar. An old wxWidgets bug\regression.

Later
- VGA: "Also, it would be cool if the states had one extra column with the name of the thing that is using them."
  - Check to see if any things use states that use the wrong type of action (weapon or monster).
- Mark and display items (things, states, strings, ammo, weapons, sounds) as modified compared to engine config.
- Muzzle flash support for weapon state previews. Possible if we know what thing or weapon uses a state.
- Add other Doom Retro fields from https://github.com/bradharding/doomretro/wiki/INFORMATION-FOR-MAPPERS#DEHACKED-LUMPS (though not yet Retro bits)
    - See what other fields Doom Retro supports but hasn't documented yet. Look at it's Dehacked parser.
- Final Doom (TNT and Plutonia) support, see https://www.doomworld.com/forum/topic/117871-dehacked-30a-special-edition-with-support-for-both-final-doom-versions/?tab=comments#comment-2212475
- Manually clear list of recent files.
- Investigate pyInstaller for executable generation. Single file, less dependencies?
- UI manual \ Dehacked tutorial.
- Look into new Eternity Engine and PrBoom+ Dehacked features.
- "Would've been better if WhackEd allowed to name the states like in the source code. Then you could reference them
   by names rather than by numbers, and moving large chunks of the table would be trivial. You'd only be limited by
   its size. Then again, if you want to make a complex TC in Boom, convenience is something you shouldn't be taking
   for granted.", Da Werecat
- Extend patch merging by https://www.doomworld.com/vb/post/1556253
- Action sound playback data for the Hexen + Heretic + ZDoom action functions.
- Allow multiple flag fields for things (and implement Doom Retro's "Retro Bits" field).
- Allow sorting things list by name.
- '...' button for actions to browse through list of actions plus a description.
  - Fix action descriptions first, not all correspond with what the actual Doom code does. Check with Doom code in p_pspr and p_enemy.
- VGA: "Also, it would be cool if the states had one extra column with the name of the thing that is using them."
  - Check to see if any things use states that use the wrong type of action (weapon or monster).
- Simplify engine config structure for faster parsing. For example states and things could be listed as array with a key entry.
- DEHSUPP support. See GitHub issue #1.
- ZDaemon: Add and parse relevant actors from http://www.zdaemon.org/?CMD=info&NAME=deh. Is this related to DEHSUPP?
- Read\write DEHACKED lumps directly from a WAD file.
- Improve tab traversal everywhere.
- Mark and display items as modified compared to engine config.
- Proper high DPI support. Needs wxFormBuilder to output device independent pixels. See https://github.com/wxFormBuilder/wxFormBuilder/issues/356

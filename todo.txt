Known bugs
- Thing editor property fields do not scale well when resized.
- Fix column widths with different font sizes. Auto-sizing based on font and text contents?

Low priority bugs
- State Editor: flash when selecting states. Related to parameters UI.
- When listview column widths are resized, a scrollbar is sometimes displayed for no reason.
- Toolbar buttons clickable area does not extend to the side of the toolbar. An old wxWidgets bug\regression.

Features
1.2.0
- Allow multiple flag fields for things (and implement Doom Retro's "Retro Bits" field).
- Allow 0-rotation sprites to replace rotation sprites. SKELC0 replaces all of SKELC* rotations if present in a later
  loaded WAD. Configurable in patch settings dialog, since vanilla Doom and Chocolate Doom do not allow this, but most
  source ports do. See https://www.doomworld.com/vb/post/1558457
- Add DooMRetro "Gib health" thing property. See https://github.com/bradharding/doomretro/commit/64cba7dbb9e952a6d56ddccf25c650c64ffdc389
- Being able to copy/paste the properties of a state. "About the copy paste, I think all lines should be copied and when
  pasted they should be pasted all at once again. If the lines selected when copying are more than the ones when
  pasting, then the extra copied ones would be ignored. If they were less, then only that nummber of lines will be
  modified, the rest of the selected lines will be unmodified. So if the user selects 9 frames (f.e. a death
  animation), he can then select haphazardly some blank frames from 1300 to 1350, not caring too much, then he pastes
  over and the frames from 1300 to 1308 get modified/overwritten, not the rest."
- Being able to select some states, right click and select "link frames" or something. And that would make each state's
  "next" point to the next higher one that is selected, until the last one. For example, I select states 4, 5, 9, 10
  (order of selection doesn't matter). With that button Whacked would make each lower one point to the higher one,
  the last one's "next" stays the same I guess.
- Allow sorting things list by name.
- "When having multiple states selected, and you change only the sprite family, the sprite numbers also all become 0.
  Can you make them stay the same as they were?"

1.3.0
- Press space in the state editor or right mouse button on a state label to start a preview animation at that state.
- Mark and display items as modified compared to engine config.
- '...' button for actions to browse through list of actions plus a description.
- VGA: "Also, it would be cool if the states had one extra column with the name of the thing that is using them."
  - Check to see if any things use states that use the wrong type of action (weapon or monster).

- Simplify engine config structure for faster parsing.
- Merge patches by loading a patch "over" the current one.
  - Or like https://www.doomworld.com/vb/post/1556253
- DEHSUPP support. See GitHub issue #1.
- ZDaemon: Add and parse relevant actors from http://www.zdaemon.org/?CMD=info&NAME=deh. Is this related to DEHSUPP?
- UI manual \ Dehacked tutorial.
- Read\write DEHACKED lumps directly from a WAD file.
- Allow includes for cfg files to modularize them.
- Improve tab traversal everywhere.

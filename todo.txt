Patch extensions
- Thing editor MF2, MF3, MF4 flags.
- Armor classes can accept fixed point ("1.5") value types for some configs. Also expose as config feature.
- ZDaemon:
  - Update with actions and flags from here: https://github.com/GitExl/WhackEd4/issues/1 (Aeyesx post 6-sept-2015)
  - Disable Sounds editing (but not selection) and disable Cheats editor. See tables_zdaemon.cfg features object for a start.
- Toggle new Thing editor field state based on engine capability. Most new features unavailable for non-ZDaemon configs.
- Verify that new thing, state, misc and other features for ZDaemon\MBF are written and read from patch files properly.

Bugs
- When opening a Dehacked file directly from Explorer, res files cannot be found because they are loaded from the current path, and not the application path.
- VGA: "Second problem is that when loading my wad, which has SS Nazi gfx replacements, the SSWVE* and some of the next frames show the originals, not the modified ones."
       The 0 rotation takes precedence in WhackEd4. I don't think it should be this way, because the game does the opposite.

- VGA: "On another note, I believe the beta items should not exist in the MBF preset."
- State Editor: flash when selecting states. Related to parameters UI.
- When listview column widths are resized, a scrollbar is sometimes displayed for no reason.
- Toolbar buttons clickable area does not extend to the side of the toolbar. A wxWidgets bug.

Features
- VGA: "Also, it would be cool if the states had one extra column with the name of the thing that is using them."
- '...' button for actions to browse through list of actions plus a description.
- Press space in the state editor or right mouse button on a state label to start a preview animation at that state.
- UI manual \ Dehacked tutorial.
- Allow sorting things list by name.
- Tab control traversal. Will need UI layout changes (put controls into panels instead of directly into frames, see Misc editor sidebar).
- Read\write DEHACKED lumps directly from a WAD file.
- Mark some actions as weapon or monster only, and allow checking to see if any things use states that use the wrong type of action.

Other
- VGA: "If you want an active tester PM me the WIP version please :-D"

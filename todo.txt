Features
- Press space in the state editor or right mouse button on a state label to start a preview animation at that state.
- Somewhere to display state action descriptions?
- ESC should close dialogs where appropriate, for example the string editor.
- UI manual \ Dehacked tutorial.
- Allow sorting things list by name.
- Tab control traversal. Will need UI layout changes (put controls into panels instead of directly into frames).

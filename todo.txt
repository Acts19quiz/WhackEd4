Known bugs
- settings.json ended up being empty: https://www.doomworld.com/vb/doom-editing/89861-whacked4-problem/
- Thing editor property fields do not scale well when resized.
- Fix column widths with different font sizes. Auto-sizing based on font and text contents?

Low priority bugs
- State Editor: flash when selecting states. Related to parameters UI.
- When listview column widths are resized, a scrollbar is sometimes displayed for no reason.
- Toolbar buttons clickable area does not extend to the side of the toolbar. An old wxWidgets bug\regression.
- Proper HiDPI support. WxWidgets sucks for this.

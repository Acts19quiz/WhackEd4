wxWidgets upgrade bugs
- Par times dialog left side is too wide.
- Main toolbar width is wrong. Buttons too.
- iCCP incorrect color profile warnings.

Bugs
- I've been getting crashes when switching from the thing window to the frame window, or when using the frame filter. However, I was using Whacked4 through Wine so I can't be sure for now. I'll send you tracebacks if it happens later, on Windows.

Features
- Allow sorting things list by name.

Known issues
- Tab key traversal barely works if at all. Probably a bug in wxWidgets 2.9.
- When listview column widths are resized, a scrollbar is sometimes displayed for no reason.

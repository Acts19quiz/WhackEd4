Beta
- Add misc. editor.
- Make edit\copy\undo available only when an editor that supports those functions is active.
- Fix MaxLength in string dialog not counting any newlines. Why would the control do this???
- Tab key traversal barely works if at all.
- The file dialogs over the model patch settings window are not modal themselves.
- Some listcontrols that expand the last column display a scrollbar when none is needed.
- Beta test.

Release

- Finish website.

Known bugs
- Rotating sprite previews does not work correctly after Python 3 upgrade.
- settings.json ended up being empty: https://www.doomworld.com/vb/doom-editing/89861-whacked4-problem/
- Thing editor property fields do not scale well when resized.
- Fix column widths with different font sizes. Auto-sizing based on font and text contents?
- Adjust window dialogs for to better fit 1024x768 maximum screen size and with new high DPI handling.

Low priority bugs
- When listview column widths are resized, a scrollbar is sometimes displayed for no reason.
- Toolbar buttons clickable area does not extend to the side of the toolbar. An old wxWidgets bug\regression.

Features
1.2.3
- "Looks like when you restore a thing, its speed isn't being restored. Or maybe it just resets to 0. Same when copying."
- Bug related to speed conversion: https://www.doomworld.com/forum/topic/62909-whacked-4/?page=5#comment-1789026

1.3.0 and later
- UI manual \ Dehacked tutorial.
- Look into new Eternity Engine and PrBoom+ Dehacked features.
- "Would've been better if WhackEd allowed to name the states like in the source code. Then you could reference them
   by names rather than by numbers, and moving large chunks of the table would be trivial. You'd only be limited by
   its size. Then again, if you want to make a complex TC in Boom, convenience is something you shouldn't be taking
   for granted.", Da Werecat
- Extend patch merging by https://www.doomworld.com/vb/post/1556253
- Action sound playback data for the Hexen + Heretic + ZDoom action functions.
- Allow multiple flag fields for things (and implement Doom Retro's "Retro Bits" field).
- Allow sorting things list by name.
- '...' button for actions to browse through list of actions plus a description.
  - Fix action descriptions first, not all correspond with what the actual Doom code does. Check with Doom code in p_pspr and p_enemy.
- VGA: "Also, it would be cool if the states had one extra column with the name of the thing that is using them."
  - Check to see if any things use states that use the wrong type of action (weapon or monster).
- Simplify engine config structure for faster parsing.
- DEHSUPP support. See GitHub issue #1.
- ZDaemon: Add and parse relevant actors from http://www.zdaemon.org/?CMD=info&NAME=deh. Is this related to DEHSUPP?
- Read\write DEHACKED lumps directly from a WAD file.
- Allow includes for cfg files to modularize them.
- Improve tab traversal everywhere.
- Mark and display items as modified compared to engine config.
